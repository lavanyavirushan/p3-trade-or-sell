# BidMe

BidMe is an application envisioned as an eccommerce platform where sellers and buyers can come together to buys and sell household goods and other commodities. It is intended to be mutually beneficial for both parties. The program allows for sellers to put their items up either to be sold at a set price or otherwise put up for auction, increasing the chances of getting a better price for their goods. However, this price will still almost always be lower than buying the product new at retail price, which benefits buyers who are looking for items that are not necessarily new.

# Technologies/Features
